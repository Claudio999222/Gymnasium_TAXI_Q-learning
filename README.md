# Gymnasium_TAXI_Q-learning

## Overview

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the use of reinforcement learning to train an agent to play the role of a taxi driver using the OpenAI Gym Taxi-v3 environment. The notebook provides a step-by-step guide on implementing Q-learning for training the agent and includes visualizations to observe the agent's learning progress.

## Key Components

### 1. Environment
- The notebook utilizes the OpenAI Gym Taxi-v3 environment, which simulates a taxi navigating through a grid world.

### 2. Q-Learning
- Q-learning is implemented to enable the agent to learn optimal actions in different states of the environment.
- The Q-table is updated iteratively based on the agent's experiences.

### 3. Training Process
- The notebook outlines the training process, illustrating how the agent explores and exploits the environment to maximize cumulative rewards.

### 4. Visualization
- Visualizations are included to showcase the agent's progress, such as the Q-table updates and the taxi's movements in the environment.
